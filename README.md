# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overeview

After Beta testing the new PlanMyTrip app testers have recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. They specifically want us to add a weather description and the ability for users to filter out the data to match their weather preferences. From that list of travel destinations, the testers will create a travel itinerary from four cities they of their choosing.
